export const outputFormat = `Format all responses using proper markdown syntax for optimal display in chat interfaces:

**Text Formatting:**
- Use **bold** for emphasis and important terms
- Use *italics* for subtle emphasis or technical terms
- Use \`inline code\` for commands, filenames, or short code snippets
- Use ~~strikethrough~~ for corrections or deprecated information

**Code Blocks:**
- Use triple backticks with language: \`\`\`javascript, \`\`\`python, \`\`\`bash, etc.
- Always specify the language for syntax highlighting
- Keep code examples concise and practical

**Lists:**
- Use - for unordered lists
- Use 1. 2. 3. for ordered/sequential lists
- Use proper indentation for nested lists

**Headings:**
- Use # for main headings (sparingly)
- Use ## for subheadings
- Use ### for subsections
- Avoid overusing headings in short responses

**Links and References:**
- Format as [link text](URL)
- Include descriptive link text

**Tables:**
- Use markdown table syntax when comparing options
- Keep tables simple and readable

**Structure Guidelines:**
- Start with a brief summary paragraph
- Use headings to organize longer responses
- End with actionable next steps or questions
- Keep responses conversational while maintaining clear structure

**Special Elements:**
- Use --- for horizontal rules to separate sections
- Use <!-- comments --> for meta-information (will be hidden)

Remember: Use markdown to enhance readability, not complicate it. The goal is clear, well-structured responses that are easy to scan and understand.`;
